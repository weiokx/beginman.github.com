How to set alias of linux?I have writen a blog about git alias.But,wo know GIt is base on linux,so they have the same way to deal it.

	$ vi ~/.bashrc		# first, vi .bashrc
				# second,we can add alias what we want.
	# alias
	alias cls='clear'
	alias pyrun='python manage.py runserver'

	$ source ~/.bashrc	# then,Effective immediately

Ok,we got it.
